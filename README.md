# REDRIVER2

This project attempting to reverse-engineer PS1 game Driver 2;

This is probably NOT going to be a 1:1 recreation of the original source code.

- First we need to understand what's going on with all of this and how it works
- Second is to implement data format loaders as the game does
- Third is to attempt to reverse-engineer basic gameplay stuff (core mechanics - car physics, pedestrians, etc)
- Fourth is to build the game based on this reverse engineered work and get rid of hardcoded shit (there's a lot)

Project may be abandoned at any time.
