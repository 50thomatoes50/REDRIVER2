# Contributing
Pull requests which drastically alter the structure or architecture of the code will not be accepted. 
This is to maintain "sanity" whilst going back through code, comparing to the original MIPS disassembled output.
Best pull requests are which resolve bugs, finish existing decompiled methods, improve readability, introduce new decompiled methods and improve code documentation.

Also it's good to see which issues have more priority to work with here:

# Compiling
Project **must** be built only for **32 bit** platform because there are 32 bit pointers everywhere (and use of *long* which with GCC can be a 64 bit numbers)

First use [premake5](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/releases/download/v5.0.0-alpha15/premake-5.0.0-alpha15-windows.zip) to generate project files.

Dependencies (links for Windows):
- [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.12-VC.zip)
- [GLEW](https://netix.dl.sourceforge.net/project/glew/glew/2.1.0/glew-2.1.0-win32.zip)
- [OpenAL-Soft](https://openal-soft.org/openal-binaries/openal-soft-1.20.1-bin.zip)

Before running premake you need to download all dependencies.
After set next environment variables:
```
SDL2_DIR = <your_dependency_folder>\SDL2-2.0.12
GLEW_DIR = <your_dependency_folder>\glew-2.1.0
OPENAL_DIR = <your_dependency_folder>\openal-soft-1.20.1-bin
```
and run premake.

#### Markers for decompiled function names, code, etc

- [D] = decompiled
- [T] = debugged and tested
- [A] = altered code - debugging purposes or not being able to compile or run.... Can be used anywhere in the code, structures etc

# Base Versions
- **SLES-02997/SLES-12997** - 1.0 Spanish version (look for SPANISH.SYM existance)
- **SLES-02996/SLES-12996** - 1.0 Italian version (look for ITALIAN.SYM existance)

# Game Content

After you have built game executable you would want to copy entire DRIVER2 folder from game CD or image to location where executable is located.
STR files and XA files for now are converted using JPSXDec. 
- STR -> AVI (mjpg) 
- XA -> multiple WAV files
